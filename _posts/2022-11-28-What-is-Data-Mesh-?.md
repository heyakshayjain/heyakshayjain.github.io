Recently, In an interview, I was asked -

> Do you know Data Mesh?
My answer - Sorry, I Don't Know right now!

So, I don’t want my friends to face the same situation. I’m taking some time to do my research and After reading this blog you will be able to explain it in the simplest way possible.
So, Let's Start First Let's try to Remember all things we know so far! 
**[Data Warehouse, Data Mart, Data Lake](http://akshayjain.tech/2022/10/30/Data-Warhouse-vs-Data-Lake-vs-Data-mart.html)**, You can read about them in my previous blog and I recommended you to understand them first, before going forward in this blog.

**Data Mesh, Data Fabric**, etc. 
In this Blog, we'll discuss Data mesh and somewhat data fabric as well.

## Data Mesh


As you know data is getting generated every second. There is a constant need to evolve our tools and technology as well to handle the new challenges and lots of data, that's the reason why data mesh came into the picture.
It was first ever introduced by [Zhamak Dehghani](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zhamak-dehghani/). I recommend you to go through this fun interview at [Data Talks Club](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=346N_pCtYZU).In this interview, she explained about data mesh in her own words and some precious information as well.

> **In Simple Terms, Data Mesh is a type of data platform architecture that is decentralized, so that data can be made available to everyone**.

However, Data Fabric does the opposite and it's a centralized data platform architecture where ownership lies with the central system and data can be accessed through it.

If you want to Read more about Data Mesh and its implementation.I recommend going through this article -
